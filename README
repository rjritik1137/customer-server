1. clone the repo
2. go to customer-server folder
3. make sure to have `node version >=14` install the dependencies. `npm i`
4. after the dependencies are successfully installed, run `node index.js` to start the server
5. Now your express server is running on port 3000.

### Data files

1. processed.json contains basic customer information generated using lorem-ipsum api and picsum website.
2. data files are created locally stored this in local as we can't call it every 10 seconds to have the data because of limits on API request.
3. Customer data is served through /user endpoint
4. Didn't found any API online which can give multiple images everytime based on some id's.
5. Generating the random urls on the fly, as can't get from any server because of the same reason (rate limiting).
